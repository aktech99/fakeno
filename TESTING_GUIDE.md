   - Subsequent loads are cached
   - Requires internet connection

2. **Recharts on Mobile:**
   - Charts may not render perfectly on small screens
   - Touch interactions may be limited

3. **Framer Motion:**
   - Animations may stutter on low-end devices
   - Can be disabled with `prefers-reduced-motion`

4. **Blockchain Links:**
   - Solscan links point to Devnet (not Mainnet)
   - Transactions are simulated (not real)
