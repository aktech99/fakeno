# Integrity Ledger - Product Authentication & Quality Tracking

A blockchain-powered supply chain integrity and quality assurance system built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Manufacturer Dashboard (40%)
- Product registration form with comprehensive details
- View all registered products
- Generate QR codes for each product
- Real-time product list updates

### 2. Quality Inspection Interface (30%)
- Upload product images for inspection
- Simulated AI defect detection
- Record inspections with timestamps
- Inspection history tracking
- Pass/Fail status indicators

### 3. Consumer Verification (20%)
- Scan/Enter product ID for verification
- View complete product details & history
- See all quality inspection records
- Blockchain verification badges
- Downloadable reports

### 4. Immutable Audit Trail (10%)
- Cryptographic hashing for each record
- Timestamp verification
- Blockchain simulation (Firebase ready)
- Tamper-proof data integrity

## 🎯 What This Solves

Companies lose **$8 trillion every year** due to:
- Fake/counterfeit products
- Manufacturing defects that go unnoticed
- No way to prove when quality checks happened
- Lack of trust in quality data

**Integrity Ledger** acts as a "Truth Machine" for products by:
1. **Tracking every product's journey** with permanent blockchain records
2. **AI-powered quality checks** with unforgeable timestamps
3. **Enabling anyone to verify authenticity** through QR codes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Cryptographic hashing utilities
- **Database**: Firebase ready (currently mock data)
- **QR Codes**: QR code generation for products

## 🎯 10% MVP Implementation

This is a **10% MVP** focusing on:
- ✅ Beautiful, clean UI
- ✅ Core functionality demonstrations
- ✅ Mock data for rapid prototyping
- ✅ Blockchain simulation
- ⏳ Firebase integration (ready to add)
- ⏳ Real AI integration (ready to add)

## 🔐 Blockchain Simulation

The app includes cryptographic utilities that simulate blockchain functionality:
- SHA-256 hashing for immutable records
- Block creation with previous hash linking
- Chain verification
- Unique product ID generation

## 🚀 Next Steps

To make this production-ready:

1. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create Firebase project
   - Add credentials to `.env.local`
   - Enable Firestore and Storage

2. **AI Integration**
   - Integrate TensorFlow.js or Cloud Vision API
   - Train defect detection model
   - Real-time image analysis

3. **Real Blockchain**
   - Integrate with Ethereum, Polygon, or Hyperledger
   - Smart contracts for product registration
   - On-chain verification

4. **QR Code Scanning**
   - Implement camera-based QR scanner
   - Mobile-responsive scanning interface
