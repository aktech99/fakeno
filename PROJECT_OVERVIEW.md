# Integrity Ledger - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Vision

**Integrity Ledger** is a blockchain-powered supply chain integrity and quality assurance system that acts as a "Truth Machine" for products.

### The $8 Trillion Problem

Companies worldwide lose **$8 trillion annually** due to:

### 2. 🤖 AI-Powered Quality Checks
- Automated defect detection from product images
- Machine learning analysis
- Unforgeable timestamp proofs
- Transparent inspection records

### 3. ✅ Universal Verification
- Anyone can verify product authenticity
- Scan QR codes for instant verification
- View complete product history
- Blockchain-proven records (impossible to fake)

## 🔒 Blockchain Simulation

### How It Works:

```
Block 1: Product Registration
├── Timestamp: 2024-01-15 10:30:00
├── Data: {product details}
├── Previous Hash: 0x000000...
└── Hash: 0xabc123... ✓ Verified

Block 2: Quality Inspection
├── Timestamp: 2024-01-16 14:20:00
├── Data: {inspection details}
├── Previous Hash: 0xabc123... (links to Block 1)
└── Hash: 0xdef456... ✓ Verified
```

### Key Features:
- Each block references previous block's hash
- Any tampering breaks the chain
- Timestamps are cryptographically sealed
- Full audit trail from production to consumer

## 📱 Mobile-First Design
