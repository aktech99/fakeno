## 📝 Current Implementation (10% MVP)

This is a **frontend-only demonstration** with:
- Mock data storage (in-memory)
- Simulated AI analysis
- QR code generation via external API
- Blockchain utilities (ready for integration)

## 🔜 Next Steps (To Make Production-Ready)

### 1. Firebase Integration
```bash
# Add your Firebase credentials to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### 2. Real AI Integration
- Integrate TensorFlow.js for client-side detection
- Or use Cloud Vision API for server-side analysis
- Train custom defect detection model

### 3. Blockchain Integration
- Connect to Ethereum/Polygon
- Deploy smart contracts
- Implement on-chain verification

### 4. Additional Features
- User authentication
- Camera-based QR scanning
- Real-time notifications
- Export reports as PDF
- Analytics dashboard

## 🎯 Demo Flow

1. **Register a Product** → Creates product with ID + QR code
2. **Inspect the Product** → Upload image, get AI analysis
3. **Verify Authenticity** → Check product history & blockchain

## 💡 Tips

- All forms have validation
- Product IDs are auto-generated
- QR codes link to verification page
- Inspection status: Passed (green) or Failed (red)
- All data persists during the session

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
```bash
# Kill the process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
npm run dev
```

**Styling not working?**
- Refresh the browser
- Clear browser cache
- Restart the dev server

## 📞 Support
